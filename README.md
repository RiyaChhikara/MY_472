## Student's Sleep Dataset Analysis

This project provides an analysis of the Student's Sleep Dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R. The primary goal of this analysis is to transform the dataset and create a new column that represents the increase in hours of sleep as binary results. This new column can be in either numeric format (1 for an increase in sleep, 0 for no increase) or words (Yes for an increase, No for no increase).
